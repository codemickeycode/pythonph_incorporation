My suggestion for our mission:

> The mission of the Philippine Python is to advance the Filipino Python programming community ecosystem forward.

(import from http://jessenoller.com/blog/2011/04/17/explaining-the-python-software-foundation-psf-part-1)

In case we can't use the above (because its not up on the mothership yet and I don't want us to be accused of stealing from a PSF board member (but hey, we can email him and ask for permission if needed)), here is another suggestion for our mission:

> The mission of the Python Software Foundation is to promote, protect, and advance the Python programming language and its ecosystem, and to support and facilitate the growth of a diverse Filipino community of Python programmers.

p.s., the above is import PSF with some modifications. Naturally, we need to expand this to a longer version of mission.

and my suggestion for our vision:

> We want to improve the Filipino software industry and the Philippines Python Users Group believe that through our events, seminars, outreach programs, and Pythonistic approach, we can make the Filipino software industry a strategic advantage for the Philippines and its people.

I am having trouble thinking of an adjective that describe our humor, pragmatism, and craziness into one word. :p
